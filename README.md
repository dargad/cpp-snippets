Various C++ code snippets

This is a place where I plan to upload all my interesting pieces of C++. I pay attention to keeping the snippets small, independent and visualising a single feature/idea.

The origin of the first files were small prototypes of approaches, ideas and requirements. Let's see how will it develop in the future.

Enjoy!
